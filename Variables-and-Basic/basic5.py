# Basic Arithmetic Operations: Declare two integers variables 'a' and 'b' then assign the value 100 and 5 respectively. Perform arithmetic 
#                              operations (+, -, *, /) using these variables, and then print the result along with the details of the operation used.
a, b = 100, 5
print("a + b =", a + b)
print("a - b =", a - b)
print("a * b =", a * b)
print("a / b =", a / b)
