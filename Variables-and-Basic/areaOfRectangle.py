# Exercise:  Declare 2 variables width and height of a rectangle; assign the value of width and height. 
#            Calculate the area of the rectangle and provide a detailed explanation of the operation.
width = 1200
height = 1200
print("Formula of area of a rectangle:\n    Area = width * height")
print(f"We have width = {width}m and height = {height}m")
print(f"=> Area of a rectangle = {width}m * {height}m = {width * height}m^2")
